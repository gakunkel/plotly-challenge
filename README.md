A JavaScript and Plotly visualization of human belly button biodiversity.

Many of us do not often think of the wide variety of species that inhabit the surface of our skin, but places on our body such as the belly button can be home to a wide variety of OTU (operational taxonomic units)! The number and type of bacterial colonies present, of course, depend on a variety of factors including wash frequency, etc. This dashboard utilizes JavaScript, Plotly, and D3 selection tools to visualize the wide degree of biodiversity of our navels.
